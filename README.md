# lu-oop-project

## Project setup
1. Install gradle dependencies
2. Build and run project
3. Navigate to project root folder (`lu-oop-project`)
4. Run `yarn` to install npm dependencies (if you do not have yarn, install it globally)
5. Run `yarn build-css` and leave it running - css will be automatically updated as you change html files (dont forget to rebuild the project after any changes)
6. Good to go! Open `http://localhost:8080/login` and log in with automatically generated user (`admin@fms.lv`, `secret`)
